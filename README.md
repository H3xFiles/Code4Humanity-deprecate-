# Code4Humanity
This repository want to be a collaborative section, and it is dedicated to a project I had in mind for few years now. Code4Humanity is creating software using crowdsource intelligence from most coders as possible to build a an opensoftware that benefit the entire humanity worldwide. 

# Which is the reason to do that?
The first thing someone approaching this project would ask is what make you different from all the others? 
My answers is the projects will be focus on solving real issues for the world. For example, the first project I had in mind is to track down as fast as possible people who disapear. In 2018 there are still million people disapearing daily, and we are not talking about homeless or drug addicted or suicidal, but people with any reason any warning or any social backroung problem that from a moment to another they just vanish in the thin air. 

# So, us as developers what we can do about? 
I do believe that developers are problem solver of the society they are highly skilled to logically solve very complex abstract problems. Developers tend to approach problems differently because it is the daily work of a programmer or a studio of developers coming up with solutions. 

# How would it work? 
My idea is make crowdsource the entire software development process, involving more software developers as possible from the kanban board to the actual code writing. Not as different from other opensource projects, with the difference that all the stages of developing will be crowdsources, including deciding which features to implement and the best strategy using public pull systems. 

# Who can join? 
Literally the entire planet, I hope to include developers community from every part of the world of all continents. 

# Why do you think people will bother to join? 
Because I do believe that this is something that will benefict us all as humanity. Every country has problem with missing people it is not just US or Mexico, and because together we can find other issue to solve all together. Moreover, I do believe that everyone of us has the wish to do good for the world and Code4humanity in my opinion is the best way to use your skills to change the world for real. Not another piece of code of an open source project dedicated to a small community, but something that could radically change the world solving hard problems of out society. The satisfaction will come from doing something real, something that matter, something that you can see the effect on the real life and everywhere in the world. 

# Most needed people right now.
Soft. developers(front,back), Data scientists, legal experts

# An example:  From WhatsApp conversation ... 
[11:27, 8/26/2018] Fra: how can we find this people using technology? 
[11:28, 8/26/2018] Fra: because people do not vanish in thin air, missing people are around us, we just do not know if someone is missing.
[11:28, 8/26/2018] Fra: For example, an italian guy disappeared in Amsterdam for a week.
[11:29, 8/26/2018] Fra: How many people he met before dying?
[11:30, 8/26/2018] Fra: what if we had the technology to instantly crowdsourcing all the possible source of intelligence, including immediate information sharing with everyone of the area ...
[11:32, 8/26/2018] Fra: Like everyone in the amsterdam area with "app name" installed would receive a warning to look for this person, asking to take as much pictures of the surrounding, to checkin if they see the person sending the time and location of the encounter.
