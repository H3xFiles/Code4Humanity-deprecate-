# What is the issue? 
I can write millions of lines about the issue, but instead I give you the links to the missing people page and their photo. Watch them in the eyes and tell me you don't feel to do something about. I will link a European report that state ["In  2017,  the  network  of  hotlines  received  189054 calls. Hotlines  for  missing  children provided support to calls and cases relating to 5621 missing children. 19% of  the missing children reported to  hotlines faced violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation."](http://missingchildreneurope.eu/Portals/0/Docs/Annual%20and%20Data%20reports/Figures%20and%20Trends%20Report%202017.pdf)
